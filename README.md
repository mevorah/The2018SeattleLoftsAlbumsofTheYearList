The opening track has Elvis Costello at his worst. What really pulled me in was the guitar on Opportunity, and the Ska-esq bass on The Imposter. By Secondary Modern, vocals have dropped to bearable levels. King Horse brings the entire band onto the same level, opening the rest of the album. Perhaps the first three songs grouped together can be thought of as the intro? This would be plausible, but then comes Possesion, as if starting from the beginnig again.

On the second listen, finally hear what this album is about - the landscape of dejection and teenage life in the late 80s. To a certain extent some lyrics feel dated. With that said, certain clumsely placed lyrics contribute to the genuiness of some of these songs. Musically this album contains some expansive ideas, all executed by a group that serves as a prime example of what is meant to be a 'tight band'.

Only one single if any - Sound and Vision. Otherwise the album lives only as a whole - tracking Bowies progression from addiction to the next phase in his career.
