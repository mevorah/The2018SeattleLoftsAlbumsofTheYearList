There are certainly albums on this list that I've listened to countless (n) times, but this project is really aimed at filling my musical blindspots. It's more than listening to an album once - most demand several listens (see: *Low*). Rating scale below:

**Scale**
1. ***Incredible / Amazing*** - The album as a whole is an experience
2. ***Very Good*** - All songs are great, a couple resulting in a cathartic response
3. ***Pretty Good*** - Entirely listenable, a couple of songs are stand outs
4. ***Ok*** - Hit or miss, a couple of solid songs but then a bunch of filler (see:Appetite For Destruction)
5. ***Not Great*** - Some songs are listenable, but overall just a chore to listen to
6. ***Awful / The Worst*** - Little is redeeming, a pretty rough listening experience

* 3rd Listen: Pretty/ very good

## 8/13 Loveless - My Bloody Valentine
* 1st Listen: Pretty good

## 8/12 What's The Story Morning Glory - Oasis
* 1st Listen: Pretty good

There are different schools of Beatles emulation, and it's difficult to say who did it right and who did it best. See *Dusk In Cubist Castle - The Olivia Tremor Control*, then listen to this. The former edges toward experimentation - a bit rawer, extending what came before. The latter drills into the sweet spot, creating some great pop. When all is said and done both succeed in what they aim (as far as anyone can tell) to do.

For a less focussed listen, of the two, I'd opt for this guy.

## 8/11 Isolation Drills - Guided By Voices

## 8/7 Reign In Blood - Slayer
* 1st Listen: Ok

When I listened to Husker Du and Black Flag this year, In both cases I was left slightly disapointed - Is this really thrashmetal/ hardcore? Is this really as fast as it goes? The answer is Slayer. Whether you typically hold lyrical content in high regard from your very first listen (I don't), the raise in heart rate is undeniable from this album's first track.

Textures and total creepiness - this album is nuts. The texture makes up for the simplicity, but when all is said and done, I would never listen to anything (but Ghost Rider) on this album if I didn't have to.

## 6/6 A Ghost Is Born - Wilco
* Nth Listen: Very good

An album I once considered unlistenable. Once I heard the live album once or nine times, I was hooked. This album comes alive after five listens - fantastic lyrics, exprimentation. People who say this album is a misfire after Yankee Hotel Foxtrot haven't given it the proper time. This album is no Smiley Smile - it switches it up in the best ways while not overly hanging on the coattails of its predecessor.

## 6/5 Every Picture Tells A Story - Rod Stewart
* 1st Listen: Ok
* 2nd Listen: Ok

The drums on *Every Picture Tells A Story* and the song *Maggie May* are highlights.

## 6/4 Band On The Run - Wings
* 1st Listen: Pretty good
* 2nd Listen: Pretty good
* 3rd Listen: Pretty/ very good
* 4th Listen: Pretty/ very good
* 5th Listen: Pretty/ very good

Paul McCartney opens up with two huge songs. The rest of the album is spent dipping his toes into several genres. One has to admire his tastefulness in doing so. Mamunia for instance - a song that channels aspects of African music, while remaining grounded in McCartney's pop sensibility. It is something that comes off as refreshing in contrast to Paul Simon's *Graceland*. He does this all over the album.

While generally executed well, there is some needless filler *see: Bluebird*. However, despite the choppy mix, McCartney wraps everything up well in *Picasso's Last Words*. This is a great album.

## 6/3 Fakebook - Yo La Tengo
* 1st Listen: Ok/ pretty good
* 2nd Listen: Ok/ pretty good
* 3rd Listen: Pretty good
* 4th Listen (7-27): Pretty good

What a mixed bag. So hard to rate such an album.. but pretty good.

## 6/2 Keep It Like A Secret - Built To Spill
* Nth Listen: Pretty/ very good

## 6/1 Bat Out of Hell - Meat Loaf
* 1st Listen: Ok

There are moments on this album that are unbearable.

## 5/31 Ace of Spades - Motorhead
* 1st Listen: Ok

## 5/30 Paranoid - Black Sabbath
* 1st Listen: Pretty good

## 5/29 Dig Me Out - Sleater-Kinney
* 1st Listen: Ok
* 2nd Listen: Ok
* 3rd Listen: Ok/ pretty good
* 4th Listen: Ok/ pretty good

## 5/28 An Awesome Wave - Alt-j
* 1st Listen: Not great/ Ok

## 5/27 Cleopatra - The Lumineers
* 1st Listen: Ok/ pretty good

## 5/26 Electric Ladyland - Jimi Hendrix
* 1st Listen: Ok/ pretty good
* 2nd Listen: Ok/ pretty good

To look up: Was this pre or post meeting Dave Mason? As with previous albums, Jimi Hendrix turns everything on its head. But for this guy the background vocals unfortunately detract - see cross town traffic. They're vocals that are completely fixed in the 70s sound. Vocals that pull some aspects of this album (helplessly) into the 70s, robbing the music of a sense of timelessness that is found on his other albums.

But with that said, there are standouts on this album - despite the sound of Traffic, Crosstown Traffic - Voodoo Chile - Burning of the Midnight Lamp. Always inventive, his face-melting solos are a highlight.

I guess what I'm trying to say is.. Traffic. Is. The. Worst.

## 5/25 Goodbye Yellow Brick Road - Elton John
* 1st Listen: Ok/ pretty good

## 5/24 War - U2
* 1st Listen: Ok/ pretty good

## 5/23 Legend - Bob Marley and the Wailers
* 1st Listen: Pretty/ very good

Every great reggae song has been put on this album. What a tour de force of... reggae. Pretty/ very good.

## 5/22 Brighten The Corners - Pavement

You can feel the energy.. even when standing at your desk. I think that's the point.

## 5/12 Torches - Foster The People

* 3rd Listen: Pretty good

## 5/9 Bubble & Scrape - Sebadoh
* 1st Listen: Ok
* 2nd Listen: Pretty good
* 3rd Listen: Pretty good

This album is in the mix. The tonality is inventive. There are big songs. The lyrics at times are lacking, but when all is said and done - what a break up album!

## 5/8 Psychocandy - The Jesus And Mary Chain
* 1st Listen: Ok/ pretty good
* 2nd Listen: Pretty good
* 3rd Listen: Pretty good

It starts off strong, but after six songs the texture grows old.

## 5/7 Double Nickels On The Dime - Minutemen
* 1st Listen: Pretty good
* 2nd Listen: Pretty good
* 3rd Listen: Pretty/ very good

You have to realize that it's a lot - over an hour long is tough. Once digested, there's a lot of greatness in this album - Mile Watt's bass is prominent throughout. The main attraction is D Boone's guitar work - treble turned to 11, funk strumming, and imperfect shredding. The album feels like summer - but not beach summer. It has the feeling of roadtrip/ errand summer in the 85 degree heat where a cloud of brown dust kicks up as a pickup truck drives away as you wait for your shitty 85' (insert car name) to fill up.

With the over saturation of the beach summer music, Double Nickels On The Dime comes welcomed with arms wide open.

## 5/6 You're Living All Over Me - Dinosaur Jr.
* 1st Listen: Ok/ pretty good
* 2nd Listen: Pretty good
* 3rd Listen: Pretty good

* 5th Listen: Pretty/ very good

## 5/5 This Is Happening - LCD Soundsystem
* Nth Listen: Pretty good

## 5/4 Saturday Night Fever - Various
* 1st Listen: Ok
The first handful of songs are incredible. Unfortunately, the rest feels like movie filler. A fairly imbalanced album.

## 5/3 Screamadelica - Primal Scream
* 1st Listen: Ok
* 2nd Listen: Ok
* 3rd Listen: Pretty good

## 5/2 Perfect From Now On - Built To Spill

* 1st Listen: Not great/ ok
* 2nd Listen: Not great/ ok

## 4/30 The Clash - The Clash
* 1st Listen: Ok
* 2nd Listen: Ok/ pretty good

On first listen, The Clash appear my rhythmically vaired than The Ramones, and more accessible than the Sex Pistols.

## 4/29 Gimme Fiction - Spoon
* Nth Listen: Pretty/ very good

## 4/28 Rubber Soul - The Beatles
* 1st Listen: Pretty/ very good

## 4/27 Like A Virgin - Madonna

## 4/23 Aquemini - Outkast
* 1st Listen: Ok

## 4/22 Modern Vampires of the City - Vampire Weekend
* 1st Listen: Pretty good
* 2nd Listen: Pretty good

What is it about this album that makes it seem Koanig's voice is completely separated from the music. The album is pretty good despite this. None the less, I wonder if this is what's meant when people say they could "hear the pro tools"?

## 4/21 Summerteeth - Wilco
* 1st Listen: Pretty/ very good
* 2nd Listen: Pretty/ very good

First listen in a couple of years.

## 4/20 Damn The Torpedoes - Tom Petty And The Heartbreakers
* 1st Listen: Ok

## 4/19 Townes Van Zandt - Townes Van Zandt
* 1st Listen: Ok
* 2nd Listen: Ok/ pretty good

The album is really in its lyrics. Thoroughly enjoyable songs, albeit few memorable.

## 4/18 Aja - Steely Dan
* 1st Listen: Not great/ ok

## 4/17 The Stranger - Billy Joel
* 1st Listen: Pretty/ very good

Like Springsteen, once you get over the cheesiness, the music is verrry good.

## 4/16 Spiderland - Slint

## 4/15 Bee Thousand - Guided By Voices

## 4/13 Grace - Jeff Buckley
* 1st Listen: Ok
* 2nd Listen: Ok
* 3rd Listen: Ok/ pretty good
* 4th Listen: Pretty/ very good

The guy's singing is unbelievable! With that said, there were few songs that actually hooked me.

## 4/12 Ramones - Ramones
* 1st Listen: Ok/ pretty good
* 2nd Listen: Pretty good

This album is upbeat, but wow how every song sounds the same. Great for starting your day, but nothing that is truly amazing.

## 4/11 American Water - Silver Jews
* 1st Listen: Pretty (very?) good
* 2nd Listen: Pretty good
* 3rd Listen: Pretty good
* 4th Listen: Pretty/ very good
* 5th Listen: Pretty/ very good

How this album has grown on me! By the 4th listen it's all I could think about. The harmonies are a highlight.

## 4/10 Astral Weeks - Van Morrison
* 1st Listen: Pretty good
* 2nd Listen: Not great/ ok
* 3rd Listen: Not great

On second listen, I could barely get through. The songs all sound the same in. When you space back in, you realize that Van Morrison has been screaming in your ear for the past twenty minutes. My response: Van Morrison suuuucks.

## 4/9 Alien Lanes - Guided By Voices
* 1st Listen: Ok/ pretty good
* 2nd Listen: Pretty good
* 3rd Listen: Pretty/ very good
* 4th Listen: Very good
* 5th Listen: Very good

This album is quantity and quality. When I thought I had rediscovered all of those songs I had once heard in passing as a child, I came upon this album (Motor Away). The flawless first half makes up for the more challenging second. Very good.

## 3/18 The Lonesome Crowded West - Modest Mouse
* 1st Listen: Pretty/ very good
* 2nd Listen: Very good
* 3rd Listen: Very good

This album is the concentrate of Modest Mouse.

## 3/17 Dusk At Cubist Castle - The Olivia Tremor Control
* 1st Listen: Pretty.. very? good
* 2nd Listen: Very good
* 3rd Listen: Very good
* 4th Listen: Very good
* 5th Listen: Very good

Definitively, very good. Pop that doesn't emulate, but builds on those that came before. It feels as though The Beatles' experimentation had been boiled down into ideas that worked and those that didn't - the ideas that worked soley realized through this album. Everything from *Jumping Fences* to the 10x *Green Typewriters* - "How much longer.. can I wait?", in 1996 we had  arrived.

## 3/16 Richard D. James Album - Aphex Twin
* 4th or 5th Listen: Pretty good
* 6th Listen: Pretty good

I can't help but think that I found this album pretty inacessible on the first listen. After three or four more over the course of the last few years, I think I'm sold. *4* opens the album and goddamn what an opener - the drum machine, the melody that feels like an electric eel working its way through a computer. The sounds and textures feel tangible. The emotion that is wrung out the circuits that made this album (especially on *Girl/Boy*) - palpable. Strangely, with the highlights so bright, there is a sense of filler. That is, filler that will almost certainly win me over in the years to come. Bravo Richard D. James, bravo.

## 3/15 Electric Warrior - T. Rex
* 1st Listen: Pretty good
* 2nd Listen: Pretty good
* 3rd Listen: Pretty/ very good

So hard to tell who influenced them and who they influenced - the opening track sounds like the Black Keys. The follow ups sound like they ripped off Bowie and the Beatles. T.Rex, man.. pretty.. good.

## 3/14 Painful - Yo La Tengo
* 1st Listen: Pretty/ very good
* 2nd Listen: Pretty/ very good
* 3rd Listen: Very good

*Highlights:* I Was the Fool Beside You for Too Long, The Whole of the Law

Wow. The album brings you somewhere else.

## 3/13 Thriller - Michael Jackson
* 1st Listen: Pretty/ very good

Sooo many hits.

## 3/12 The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan - Bob Dylan
* 1st Listen: Pretty good
* 2nd Listen: Pretty/ very good

## 3/11 Light Upon The Lake - Whitney
* Nth Listen: Very good

It's amazing that after nearly two years of regular listening, I haven't gotten sick of this album. Perhaps the best summer album ever put to recording medium.

## 3/10 Amnesiac - Radiohead
* 1st Listen: Pretty/ very good

## 3/9 Otis Blue Otis Redding Sings Soul - Otis Redding
* 1st Listen: Pretty/ very good

## 3/8 Gilberto Gil - Gilberto Gil
* 1st Listen: Pretty good

Should I ever be stranded in dire circumstances, I only hope I have this album - happy, experimental music that makes you feel as though you're treking the Amazon rainforest. Cheers Gilberto, cheers.

## 3/7 Slanted And Enchanted - Pavement
* 1st Listen: Pretty good
* 2nd Listen: Pretty/ very good
* 3rd Listen: Very good

## 3/6 The Black Saint And The Sinner Lady - Charles Mingus
* 1st Listen: Pretty good
* 2nd Listen: Pretty good

More tolerable than free form jazz - Mingus actually has a composition he's working with. Employing a variety of musicians, he leads the group to create some emotional music.

## 3/5 Aftermath - Rolling Stones
* 1st Listen: Ok/ pretty good
* 2nd Listen: Pretty good (maybe very good)
* 3rd Listen: Pretty/ very good

## 3/3 Smiley Smile - Beach Boys
* 1st/ 2nd Listen: Ok/ pretty good

*Good Vibrations* is amazing, but the rest of the album leaves a lot to be desired after Pet Sounds. Some tracks are needlessly obscure (She's Goin Bald), others range between ok and pretty good. *Ok/ pretty good*.

## 3/2/3 Last Splash - The Breeders
* 1st Listen: Pretty good
* 2nd Listen: Pretty good
* 3rd Listen: Pretty/ very good
* 4th Listen: Very good
* 5th Listen: Very good
* 6th Listen: Very good

This album is thoroughly enjoyable all the way through. It's clear to see Kim Deal's influence on the Pixes.

## 3/2 Trompe Le Monde - Pixies
* 1st Listen: Ok/ pretty good
* 2nd Listen: Pretty good
* 3rd Listen: Pretty/ very good
* 4th Listen: Very good
* 5th Listen: Very good

This album is great. Albeit not as varied as Doolitle, this album still has direction. I find my self regulary going back to it. There's anger, layers, and hooks - I'm hooked.

## 3/1 Os Mutantes - Os Mutantes
* 1st Listen: Pretty good

Panis Et Circenses - some boroque, some tape delays; can this be the Brazilian Beach Boys or Beatles? A Minha Menina - nope! The album is rich with experimentation - take O Relógio, with an intro that's practically drowning in reverb, with a quick-cut to colage of tropicalia.

## 2/28 Stand - Sly & The Family Stone
* 1st Listen: Pretty good

## 2/27 I Never Loved A Man The Way I Love You - Aretha Franklin
* 1st Listen: Pretty/ very good
* 2nd Listen: Pretty good

## 2/26 Andy Warhole - The Velvet Underground
* 1st Listen: Ok/ pretty good

Better than Pet Sounds? I. Don't. Think. So.

## 2/25 After The Gold Rush - Neil Young
* ~5th Listen: Very good

The songs stand for themselves - keeping instrumentation to a minimum, Neil Young puts a lot of this album's weight on its melodies. He fully succeeds.

## 2/24 Helplessness Blues - Fleet Foxes
* Nth Listen: Pretty/ very good

I hadn't listened to this album in seven years. With a fresh look, it's still great. If I had an orchard, I'd work til I'm sore - I would too.. I would too.

## 2/23 Blonde On Blonde - Bob Dylan
* 1st Listen: Pretty/ very good

## 2/22 Elvis Presley - Elvis Presley
* 1st Listen: Pretty good

So this guy Elvis is pretty good.

## 2/21 Getz/ Gilberto - Stan Getz
* 1st Listen: Pretty good

This album is easy - it doesn't take multiple listens to get or enjoy. Is the pay-off less? Perhaps so. But when you're on-call, this refreshing album may be the best break in your week.

## 2/20 Sunshine Superman - Donovan
* 1st Listen: Ok/ pretty good

## 2/19 Kid A - Radiohead
* 1st Listen: Very good
* 2nd Listen: Very good
* 3rd Listen: Very good
* 4th Listen: Very good/ incredible

Hearing rock influences is so common, but this is the first where I heard electronic. Aphex Twin is all over this (in the best ways)! Thom Yorke's voice bends between instruments. Every track evokes emotion. 10/11 - Mark Mevorah, New York Times

## 2/18 Back To Black - Amy Winehouse
* 1st Listen: Pretty good

## 2/17 Blue - Joni Mitchell
* 1st Listen: Ok/ pretty good

## 2/16 Reckoning - R.E.M
* 1st Listen: Pretty good

## 2/15 Goo - Sonic Youth
* 1st Listen: Ok/ pretty good
* 2nd Listen: Ok/ pretty good

This album is crazy hit or miss.

## 2/14 Sign 'O' The Times - Prince
* 1st Listen: Pretty good

## 2/13 Rio - Duran Duran
* 1st Listen: Not great
* 2nd Listen: Ok

## 2/12 Bitches Brew - Miles Davis
* 1st Listen: Pretty good

But honestly, how do you rate such an album. It's clear that this album is great, but I have no idea why. Lets bank on future listens.

## 2/11 More Songs About Buildings And Food - Talking Heads
* 1st Listen: Unknown
* 2nd Listen: Pretty/ very good
* 3rd Listen: Pretty/ very good

## 2/10 Odelay - Beck
* Nth Listen: Very good/ Amazing
* Reevaluation: Very good

I love this album. Perhaps the perfect backdrop for a summer house party.

## 2/9 Another Green World - Brian Eno
* 1st Listen: Pretty/ very good
* 2nd Listen (Same Day): Pretty/ very good
* 3rd Listen: Pretty good

## 2/8 Cosmo's Factory - Creedence Clearwater Revival
* 1st Listen: Pretty good

## 2/7 Station To Station - David Bowie
* 1st Listen: Pretty/ very good
* 2nd Listen: Pretty/ very good

## 2/6 Paul Simon - Paul Simon
* 1st Listen: Very good
* 2nd Listen: Pretty/ very good
* 3rd Listen: Pretty/ very good
* 4th Listen: Very good

Fantastic songs, Paul Simon's voice is incredible - surely an influence on Elliot Smith. Upon the second listen, the lyrics were lacking in a handfull of songs. Third listen will tell.

## 2/5 Crooked Rain, Crooked Rain - Pavement
* 1st Listen: Pretty good
* 2nd Listen: Very good/ (may be incredible)

So many influences and deadpan lyrics, and so much musical variety - this album may have it all. Phenomenal.

## 2/4 High Violet - The National
* **Nth Listen: Very good**

## 2/3 Post - Bjork
* 1st Listen: Ok/ Pretty good
* 2nd Listen: Pretty good

## 2/2 Exile On Main Street - Rolling Stones
* 1st Listen: Ok/ Pretty good
* 2nd Listen: Pretty good
* 3rd Listen: Pretty good
* 4th Listen: Very good
* 5th Listen: Very good
* 6th Listen: Very good

So many instruments going. Super upbeat. Thoroughly enjoyable.

## 2/1 Q: Are We Not Men? A: We Are Devo! - Devo
* 1st Listen: Ok/ pretty good
* 2nd Listen: Pretty good
* 3rd Listen: Pretty good

## 1/31 Computer World - Kraftwerk
* 1st Listen: Pretty/ very good
* 2nd Listen: Pretty/ very good

## 1/30 Call Me - Al Green
* 1st Listen: Pretty/ very good

## 1/29 Appetite For Destruction - Guns N' Roses
* 1st Listen: Ok

Slash's fantastic guitar work is present throughout the album. This along with the three solid songs on this album make it ok. Aside from that, just a ton of filler on boring subject matter.

## 1/28 The Moon & Antarctica - Modest Mouse
* Nth Listen: Incredible

## 1/27 Rumors - Fleetwood Mac
* 1st Listen: Pretty/ very good

## 1/26 Born To Run - Bruce Springsteen
* 1st Listen: Pretty/ very good
* 2nd Listen: Very good

The first half of this album is cranked up to 10. Great song writing, tasteful use of the saxaphone, great!

## 1/25 Never Mind The Bollocks - Sex Pistols
* 1st Listen: Ok/ pretty good
* 2nd Listen: Pretty good
* 3rd Listen: Pretty good
* 4th Listen: Pretty/ very good

So many catchy songs on this angry album.

## 1/24 Get Happy - Elvis Costello And The Attractions
* 1st Listen: Ok/ pretty good

The opening track has Elvis Costello at his worst. What really pulled me in was the guitar on Opportunity, and the Ska-esq bass on The Imposter. By Secondary Modern, vocals have dropped to bearable levels. King Horse brings the entire band onto the same level, opening the rest of the album. Perhaps the first three songs grouped together can be thought of as the intro? This would be plausible, but then comes Possesion, as if starting from the beginnig again.

## 1/23 Abraxas - Santana
* 1st Listen: Ok/ pretty good
* 2nd Listen: Ok/ pretty good

## 1/22 Rain Dogs - Tom Waits
* 1st Listen: Pretty good
* 2nd Listen: Pretty/ very good

The landscapes he paints with his music is extraordinary. The percusion is a highlight.

## 1/21 Illinois - Sufjan Stevens
* Nth Listen: Very good

## 1/20 The Queen Is Dead - The Smiths
* 1st Listen: Ok
* 2nd Listen: Ok

## 1/19 Let It Be - The Replacements
* 1st Listen: Pretty good
* 2nd Listen: Pretty/ very good
* 3rd Listen: Pretty/ very good

## 1/18 Daydream Nation - Sonic Youth
* 1st Listen: Pretty good
* 2nd Listen: Pretty/ very good

On the second listen, finally hear what this album is about - the landscape of dejection and teenage life in the late 80s. To a certain extent some lyrics feel dated. With that said, certain clumsely placed lyrics contribute to the genuiness of some of these songs. Musically this album contains some expansive ideas, all executed by a group that serves as a prime example of what is meant to be a 'tight band'.

## 1/17 Murmur - R.E.M
* 1st Listen: Pretty good
* 2nd Listen: Pretty good
* 3rd Listen: Very good
* 4th Listen (7-18): Pretty/ very good

There is no doubt that this is a great album with excellent song writing.. but god damn does the production feel dated, as though firmly stuck in the era of 80's dad-rock.

## 1/16 Purple Rain - Prince
* 1st Listen: Pretty good

## 1/15 Remain In Light - Talking Heads
* 1st Listen: Ok
* 2nd Listen: Pretty/ very good
* 3rd Listen: Pretty/ very good
* 4th Listen: Very good
* 5th Listen: Very good

The sounds of the 80s? It took time, but this album is fantastic.

## 1/14 Revolver - The Beatles
* Nth Listen: Very good
* N+1 Listen: Very good

This album is so great. Although I'm not crazy about the sitar parts, the highlights more than make up for it.

## 1/13 Joshua Tree - U2
* 1st Listen: Pretty good
* 2nd Listen: Pretty/ Very good
* 3rd Listen: Very good
* 4th Listen: Very good

Production has aged very well. Every song is a standout. Phenomenal arrangement, the entire album flow is fantastic.

## 1/12 Violent Femmes - Violent Femmes
* 1st Listen: Very good
* 2nd Listen: Very good
* 3rd Listen: Very good
* 4th Listen: Very good

## 1/11 Nebraska - Bruce Springsteen
* 1st Listen: Pretty good

* Re considered: Pretty good

## 1/10 Graceland - Paul Simon
* 1st Listen: Pretty good
* 2nd Listen: Pretty good

## 1/9 Scary Monsters- David Bowie
* 1st Listen: Pretty good

## 1/8 Paul’s Boutique - Beastie Boys
* 1st Listen: Pretty good

## 1/7 In the Aeroplane Over The Sea - Neutral Milk Hotel
* Nth Listen: Amazing

## 1/6 New Day Rising - Hüsker Du
* 1st Listen: Ok

## 1/6 13 Songs - Fugazi
* 1st Listen: Ok
* 2nd Listen: Unknown
* 3rd Listen: Pretty good

## 1/5 Zen Arcade - Hüsker Du
* 1st Listen: Ok

## 1/4 Everything Falls Apart - Hüsker Du
* 1st Listen: Not great

## 1/3 Good Bad Not Evil - The Black Lips
* 1st Listen: Pretty good
* 2nd Listen: Pretty good

## 1/1 Low - David Bowie
 * 1st Listen: Very good
 * 2nd Listen: Very good/ amazing
 * 3rd Listen (3/16): Very good/ incredible

Only one single if any - Sound and Vision. Otherwise the album lives only as a whole - tracking Bowies progression from addiction to the next phase in his career.

Upon 3rd listen, this album holds it's rank - Just an incredible amount of ideas and innovation, forseeing the next three decades of music.
