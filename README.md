This is a project aimed at filling my musical blindspots, favoring albums I haven't heard before. With that said, there are certainly albums on this list that I've listened to countless (n) times. Anyway...

## 3/12 The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan - Bob Dylan
* 1st Listen: Pretty good

## 3/11 Light Upon The Lake - Whitney
* Nth Listen: Very good

It's amazing that after nearly two years of regular listening, I haven't gotten sick of this album. Perhaps the best summer album ever put to recording medium.

## 3/10 Amnesiac - Radiohead
* 1st Listen:

## 3/9 Otis Blue Otis Redding Sings Soul - Otis Redding
* 1st Listen: Pretty/ very good

## 3/8 Gilberto Gil - Gilberto Gil
* 1st Listen: Pretty good

Should I ever be stranded in dire circumstances, I only hope I have this album - happy, experimental music that makes you feel as though you're treking the Amazon rainforest. Cheers Gilberto, cheers.

## 3/7 Slanted And Enchanted - Pavement
* 1st Listen: Pretty good
* 2nd Listen: Pretty/ very good

## 3/6 The Black Saint And The Sinner Lady - Charles Mingus
* 1st Listen: Pretty good

More tolerable than free form jazz - Mingus actually has a composition he's working with. Employing a variety of musicians, he leads the group to create some emotional music.

## 3/5 Aftermath - Rolling Stones
* 1st Listen: Ok/ pretty good

## 3/3 Smiley Smile - Beach Boys
* 1st/ 2nd Listen: OK/ pretty good

*Good Vibrations* is amazing, but the rest of the album leaves a lot to be desired after Pet Sounds. Some tracks are needlessly obscure (She's Goin Bald), others range between ok and pretty good. *Ok/ pretty good*.

## 3/2/3 Last Splash - The Breeders
* 1st/2nd Listen: Pretty good

This album is thoroughly enjoyable all the way through. It's clear to see Kim Deal's influence on the Pixes.

## 3/2 Trompe Le Monde - Pixes
* 1st Listen: Ok/ pretty good

## 3/1 Os Mutantes - Os Mutantes
* 1st Listen: Pretty good

Panis Et Circenses - some boroque, some tape delays; can this be the Brazilian Beach Boys or Beatles? A Minha Menina - nope! The album is rich with experimentation - take O RelÃ³gio, with an intro that's practically drowning in reverb, with a quick-cut to colage of tropicalia.

## 2/28 Stand - Sly & The Family Stone
* 1st Listen: Pretty good

## 2/27 I Never Loved A Man The Way I Love You - Aretha Franklin
* 1st Listen: Pretty/ very good

## 2/26 Andy Warhole - The Velvet Underground
* 1st Listen: Ok/ pretty good

Better than Pet Sounds? I. Don't. Think. So.

## 2/25 After The Gold Rush - Neil Young
* ~5th Listen: Very good

The songs stand for themselves - keeping instrumentation to a minimum, Neil Young puts a lot of this album's weight on its melodies. He fully succeeds.

## 2/24 Helplessness Blues - Fleet Foxes
* nth Listen: Pretty/ very good

I hadn't listened to this album in seven years. With a fresh look, it's still great. If I had an orchard, I'd work til I'm sore - I would too.. I would too.

## 2/23 Blonde On Blonde - Bob Dylan
* 1st Listen: Pretty/ very good

## 2/22 Elvis Presley - Elvis Presley
* 1st Listen: Pretty good

So this guy Elvis is pretty good.

## 2/21 Getz/ Gilberto - Stan Getz
* 1st Listen: Pretty good

This album is easy - it doesn't take multiple listens to get or enjoy. Is the pay-off less? Perhaps so. But when you're on-call, this refreshing album may be the best break in your week.

## 2/20 Sunshine Superman - Donovan
* 1st Listen: Ok/ pretty good

## 2/19 Kid A - Radiohead
* 1st Listen: Very good
* 2nd Listen: Very good
* 3rd Listen: Very good
* 4th Listen: Very good/ incredible

Hearing rock influences is so common, but this is the first where I heard electronic. Aphex Twin is all over this (in the best ways)! Thom Yorke's voice bends between instruments. Every track evokes emotion. 10/11 - Mark Mevorah, New York Times

## 2/18 Back To Black - Amy Winehouse
* 1st Listen: Pretty good

## 2/17 Blue - Joni Mitchell
* 1st Listen: Ok/ pretty good

## 2/16 Reckoning - R.E.M
* 1st Listen: Pretty good

## 2/15 Goo - Sonic Youth
* 1st Listen: Ok/ pretty good

## 2/14 Sign 'O' The Times - Prince
* 1st Listen: Pretty good

## 2/13 Rio - Duran Duran
* 1st Listen: Not great

## 2/12 Bitches Brew - Miles Davis
* 1st Listen: Pretty good

But honestly, how do you rate such an album. It's clear that this album is great, but I have no idea why. Lets bank on future listens.

## 2/11 More Songs About Buildings And Food - Talking Heads
* 1st Listen: Unknown

## 2/10 Odelay - Beck
* Nth Listen: Very good/ Amazing

I love this album.

## 2/9 Another Green World - Brian Eno
* 1st Listen: Pretty/ Very good
* 2nd Listen (Same Day): Pretty/ Very good

## 2/8 Cosmo's Factory - Creedence Clearwater Revival
1st Listen: Pretty good

## 2/7 Station To Station - David Bowie
1st Listen: Pretty/ very good

## 2/6 Paul Simon - Paul Simon
* 1st Listen: Very good
* 2nd Listen: Pretty/ very good

Fantastic songs, Paul Simon's voice is incredible - surely an influence on Elliot Smith. Upon the second listen, the lyrics were lacking in a handfull of songs. Third listen will tell.

## 2/5 Crookes Rain, Crooked Rain - Pavement
* 1st Listen: Pretty good
* 2nd Listen: Very good/ (may be incredible)

So many influences and deadpan lyrics, and so much musical variety - this album may have it all. Phenomenal.

## 2/4 High Violet - The National
Nth Listen: Very good

## 2/3 Post - Bjork
* 1st Listen: Ok/ Pretty good
* 2nd Listen: Pretty good

## 2/2 Exile On Main Street - Rolling Stones
* 1st Listen: Ok/ Pretty good
* 2nd Listen: Pretty good

So many instruments going. Super upbeat. Thoroughly enjoyable blues. With that said, only a handful of songs really stand out - there is a uniformity across the album.

* 3rd Listen: Pretty good

Forget what I said, there is certainly variety on this album. It's pretty good!

## 2/1 Q: Are We Not Men? A: We Are Devo! - Devo
* 1st Listen: Ok/ pretty good
* 2nd Listen: Pretty good

## 1/31 Computer World - Kraftwerk
* 1st Listen: Pretty/ very good
* 2nd Listen: Pretty/ very good

## 1/30 Call Me - Al Green
* 1st Listen: Pretty/ very good

## 1/29 Appetite For Destruction - Guns N' Roses
* 1st Listen: Ok

Slash's fantastic guitar work is present throughout the album. This along with the three solid songs on this album make it ok. Aside from that, just a ton of filler on boring subject matter.

## 1/28 The Moon & Antarctica - Modest Mouse
Nth Listen: Incredible

## 1/27 Rumors - Fleetwood Mac
* 1st Listen: Pretty/ very good

## 1/26 Born To Run - Bruce Springsteen
* 1st Listen: Pretty/ very good
* 2nd Listen: Very good

The first half of this album is cranked up to 10. Great song writing, tasteful use of the saxaphone, great!

## 1/25 Never Mind The Bollocks - Sex Pistols
1st Listen: Ok/ pretty good

## 1/24 Get Happy - Elvis Costello And The Attractions
1st Listen: Ok/ pretty good

The opening track has Elvis Costello at his worst. What really pulled me in was the guitar on Opportunity, and the Ska-esq bass on The Imposter. By Secondary Modern, vocals have dropped to bearable levels. King Horse brings the entire band onto the same level, opening the rest of the album. Perhaps the first three songs grouped together can be thought of as the intro? This would be plausible, but then comes Possesion, as if starting from the beginnig again.

## 1/23 Abraxas - Santana
* 1st Listen: Ok/Pretty good
* 2nd Listen: Ok/Pretty good

## 1/22 Rain Dogs - Tom Waits
* 1st Listen: Pretty good
* 2nd Listen: Pretty/ very good

The landscapes he paints with his music is extraordinary. The percusion is a highlight.

## 1/21 Illinois - Sufjan Stevens
* Nth Listen: Very good

## 1/20 The Queen Is Dead - The Smiths
* 1st Listen: Ok
* 2nd Listen: Ok

## 1/19 Let It Be - The Replacements
* 1st Listen: Pretty good
* 2nd Listen: Pretty/ very good
* 3rd Listen: Pretty/ very good

## 1/18 Daydream Nation - Sonic Youth
* 1st Listen: Pretty good
* 2nd Listen: Pretty/very good

On the second listen, finally hear what this album is about - the landscape of dejection and teenage life in the late 80s. To a certain extent some lyrics feel dated. With that said, certain clumsely placed lyrics contribute to the genuiness of some of these songs. Musically this album contains some expansive ideas, all executed by a group that serves as a prime example of what is meant to be a 'tight band'.

## 1/17 Murmur - R.E.M
* 1st Listen: Pretty good
* 2nd Listen: Pretty good
* 3rd Listen: Very good

There is no doubt that this is a great album with excellent song writing.. but god damn does the production feel dated, as though firmly stuck in the era of 80's dad-rock.

## 1/16 Purple Rain - Prince
1st Listen: Pretty good

## 1/15 Remain In Light - Talking Heads
* 1st Listen: Ok
* 2nd Listen: Pretty/ very good
* 3rd Listen: Pretty/ very good

The sounds of the 80s?

## 1/14 Revolver - The Beatles
Nth Listen: Very good

## 1/13 Joshua Tree - U2
* 1st Listen: Pretty good
* 2nd Listen: Pretty/ Very good
* 3rd Listen: Very good

Production has aged very well.

## 1/12 Violent Femmes - Violent Femmes
* 1st Listen: Very good
* 2nd Listen: Very good
* **3rd Listen: Very good**

## 1/11 Nebraska - Bruce Springsteen
* 1st Listen: Pretty good
* 2nd Listen: Pretty/ very good

## 1/10 Graceland - Paul Simon
1st Listen: Pretty good

## 1/9 Scary Monsters- David Bowie
1st Listen: Pretty good

## 1/8 Paulâ€™s Boutique - Beastie Boys
1st Listen: Pretty good

## 1/7 In the Aeroplane Over The Sea - Neutral Milk Hotel
Nth Listen: Amazing

## 1/6 New Day Rising - HÃ¼sker Du
1st Listen: Ok

## 1/6 13 Songs - Fugazi
* 1st Listen: Ok
* 2nd Listen: Unknown
* 3rd Listen: Pretty good

## 1/5 Zen Arcade - HÃ¼sker Du
* 1st Listen: Ok

## 1/4 Everything Falls Apart - HÃ¼sker Du
* 1st Listen: Not great

## 1/3 Good Bad Not Evil - The Black Lips
* 1st Listen: Pretty good
* 2nd Listen: Pretty good

## 1/1 Low - David Bowie
 * 1st Listen: Very good
 * 2nd Listen: Very good/ Amazing

Only one single if any - Sound and Vision. Otherwise the album lives only as a whole - tracking Bowies progression from addiction to the next phase in his career.
