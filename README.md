This is a project aimed at filling my musical blindspots. With that, I favor albums I've never heard before. With that said, there are certainly albums on this list that I've listened to countless (n) times. Anyway...

## 2/26 Andy Warhole - The Velvet Underground
* 1st Listen:

## 2/25 After The Gold Rush - Neil Young
* ~5th Listen: Very good

The songs stand for themselves - surounded by limited instruments, Neil Young puts a lot of this album's weight on it's melodies. In doing so, he fully succeeds.

## 2/24 Helplessness Blues - Fleet Foxes
* nth Listen: Pretty/ very good

I hadn't listened to this album in seven years. With a fresh look, it's still great. If I had an orchard, I'd work til I'm sore - I would too.. I would too.

## 2/23 Blonde On Blonde - Bob Dylan
* 1st Listen: Pretty/ very good

## 2/22 Elvis Presley - Elvis Presley
* 1st Listen: Pretty good

So this guy Elvis is pretty good.

## 2/21 Getz/ Gilberto - Stan Getz
* 1st Listen: Pretty good

This album is easy - it doesn't take multiple listens to get or enjoy. Is the pay-off less? Perhaps so. But when you're on-call, this refreshing album may be the best break in your week.

## 2/20 Sunshine Superman - Donovan
* 1st Listen: Ok/ pretty good

## 2/19 Kid A - Radiohead
* 1st Listen: Very good
* 2nd Listen: Very good

Hearing rock influences is so common, but this is the first where I heard electronic. Aphex Twin is all over this (in the best way)! Thom Yorke's voice bends between instruments. Every track evokes emotion. 10/11 - Mark Mevorah, New York Times

## 2/18 Back To Black - Amy Winehouse
* 1st Listen: Pretty good

## 2/17 Blue - Joni Mitchell
* 1st Listen: Ok/ pretty good

## 2/16 Reckoning - R.E.M
* 1st Listen: Pretty good

## 2/15 Goo - Sonic Youth
* 1st Listen: Ok/ pretty good

## 2/14 Sign 'O' The Times - Prince
* 1st Listen: Pretty good

## 2/13 Rio - Duran Duran
* 1st Listen: Not great

## 2/12 Bitches Brew - Miles Davis
* 1st Listen: Pretty good

But honestly, how do you rate such an album. It's clear that this album is great, but I have no idea why. Lets bank on future listens.

## 2/11 More Songs About Buildings And Food - Talking Heads
* 1st Listen: Unknown

## 2/10 Odelay - Beck
* Nth Listen: Very good/ Amazing

I love this album.

## 2/9 Another Green World - Brian Eno
* 1st Listen: Pretty/ Very good
* 2nd Listen (Same Day): Pretty/ Very good

## 2/8 Cosmo's Factory - Creedence Clearwater Revival
1st Listen: Pretty good

## 2/7 Station To Station - David Bowie
1st Listen: Pretty/ very good

## 2/6 Paul Simon - Paul Simon
* 1st Listen: Very good
* 2nd Listen: Pretty/ very good

Fantastic songs, Paul Simon's voice is incredible - surely an influence on Elliot Smith. Upon the second listen, the lyrics were lacking in a handfull of songs. Third listen will tell.

## 2/5 Crookes Rain, Crooked Rain - Pavement
* 1st Listen: Pretty good
* 2nd Listen: Very good/ (may be incredible)

So many influences and deadpan lyrics, and so much musical variety - this album may have it all. Phenomenal.

## 2/4 High Violet - The National
Nth Listen: Very good

## 2/3 Post - Bjork
* 1st Listen: Ok/ Pretty good
* 2nd Listen: Pretty good

## 2/2 Exile On Main Street - Rolling Stones
* 1st Listen: Ok/ Pretty good
* 2nd Listen: Pretty good

So many instruments going. Super upbeat. Thoroughly enjoyable blues. With that said, only a handful of songs really stand out - there is a uniformity across the album.

## 2/1 Q: Are We Not Men? A: We Are Devo! - Devo
1st Listen: Ok/ pretty good

## 1/31 Computer World - Kraftwerk
* 1st Listen: Pretty/ very good
* 2nd Listen: Pretty/ very good

## 1/30 Call Me - Al Green
1st Listen: Pretty/ very good

## 1/29 Appetite For Destruction - Guns N' Roses
1st Listen: Ok

Slash's fantastic guitar work is present throughout the album. This along with the three solid songs on this album make it ok. Aside from that, just a ton of filler on boring subject matter.

## 1/28 The Moon & Antarctica - Modest Mouse
Nth Listen: Incredible

## 1/27 Rumors - Fleetwood Mac
1st Listen: Pretty/ very good

## 1/26 Born To Run - Bruce Springsteen
* 1st Listen: Pretty/ very good
* 2nd Listen: Very good

The first half of this album is cranked up to 10. Great song writing, tasteful use of the saxaphone, great!

## 1/25 Never Mind The Bollocks - Sex Pistols
1st Listen: Ok/ pretty good

## 1/24 Get Happy - Elvis Costello And The Attractions
1st Listen: Ok/ pretty good

The opening track has Elvis Costello at his worst. What really pulled me in was the guitar on Opportunity, and the Ska-esq bass on The Imposter. By Secondary Modern, vocals have dropped to bearable levels. King Horse brings the entire band onto the same level, opening the rest of the album. Perhaps the first three songs grouped together can be thought of as the intro? This would be plausible, but then comes Possesion, as if starting from the beginnig again.

## 1/23 Abraxas - Santana
* 1st Listen: Ok/Pretty good
* 2nd Listen: Ok/Pretty good

## 1/22 Rain Dogs - Tom Waits
* 1st Listen: Pretty good
* 2nd Listen: Pretty/ very good

The landscapes he paints with his music is extraordinary. The percusion is a highlight.

## 1/21 Illinois - Sufjan Stevens
Nth Listen: Very good

## 1/20 The Queen Is Dead - The Smiths
* 1st Listen: Ok
* 2nd Listen: Ok

## 1/19 Let It Be - The Replacements
* 1st Listen: Pretty good
* 2nd Listen: Pretty/ very good


## 1/18 Daydream Nation - Sonic Youth
* 1st Listen: Pretty good
* 2nd Listen: Pretty/very good

On the second listen, finally hear what this album is about - the landscape of dejection and teenage life in the late 80s. To a certain extent some lyrics feel dated. With that said, certain clumsely placed lyrics contribute to the genuiness of some of these songs. Musically this album contains some expansive ideas, all executed by a group that serves as a prime example of what is meant to be a 'tight band'.

## 1/17 Murmur - R.E.M
* 1st Listen: Pretty good
* 2nd Listen: Pretty good
* 3rd Listen: Very good

There is no doubt that this is a great album with excellent song writing.. but god damn does the production feel dated, as though firmly stuck in the era of 80's dad-rock.

## 1/16 Purple Rain - Prince
1st Listen: Pretty good

## 1/15 Remain In Light - Talking Heads
* 1st Listen: Ok
* 2nd Listen: Pretty/Very good

The sounds of the 80s?

## 1/14 Revolver - The Beatles
Nth Listen: Very good

## 1/13 Joshua Tree - U2
* 1st Listen: Pretty good
* 2nd Listen: Pretty/ Very good
* 3rd Listen: Very good

Production has aged very well.

## 1/12 Violent Femmes - Violent Femmes
* 1st Listen: Very good
* 2nd Listen: Very good
* **3rd Listen: Very good**

## 1/11 Nebraska - Bruce Springsteen
* 1st Listen: Pretty good
* 2nd Listen: Pretty/ very good

## 1/10 Graceland - Paul Simon
1st Listen: Pretty good

## 1/9 Scary Monsters- David Bowie
1st Listen: Pretty good

## 1/8 Paulâ€™s Boutique - Beastie Boys
1st Listen: Pretty good

## 1/7 In the Aeroplane Over The Sea - Neutral Milk Hotel
Nth Listen: Amazing

## 1/6 New Day Rising - HÃ¼sker Du
1st Listen: Ok

## 1/6 13 Songs - Fugazi
1st Listen: Ok

## 1/5 Zen Arcade - HÃ¼sker Du
1st Listen: Ok

## 1/4 Everything Falls Apart - HÃ¼sker Du
1st Listen: Not great

## 1/3 Good Bad Not Evil - The Black Lips
1st Listen: Pretty good

## 1/1 Low - David Bowie
* 1st Listen: Very good
* 2nd Listen: Very good/ Amazing

Only one single if any - Sound and Vision. Otherwise the album lives only as a whole - tracking Bowies progression from addiction to the next phase in his career.
